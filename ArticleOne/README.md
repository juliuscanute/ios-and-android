I am looking for a way to construct a bridge for Android developer to walk into iOS and an iOS developer to walk into Android by not using Cross-platform frameworks.

In these adventures, I am going to study the similarities that will make the transition quick and some differences that one needs to be careful. I am not against Cross-platform development, I love it, but in some instances, it requires a developer to jump into the native platform to achieve certain things, it might help a Cross-platform developer as well in such cases.
